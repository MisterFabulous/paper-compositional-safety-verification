\begin{abstract}
  This paper is based on the article `Compositional Safety Verification with Max-SMT` written by Marc Brockschmidt, Daniel Larraz, Albert Oliveras, Enric Rodr√¨guez-Carbonell and Albert Rubio.
  They present an automated compositional program verification technique to verify safety properties for arbitrary integer programs.
  In this paper we will inspect the inner workings of the algorithm with an example program which is minimal but complex enough to cover major parts of the algorithm.
